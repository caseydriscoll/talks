Where do bytes go?

If we were to track a single byte character, for example the letter 'A', how would it be stored and moved on a trip to a server and back again?

Say for example we create a new page on a common WordPress LEMP install. The page has a single character title 'A' and no other content or taxonomy information. 

The page is then published.

How is that byte, 0100 0001, stored in the browser, packeted through TCP/IP, POSTed to nginx, processed through PHP, committed to database and received again by the browser?

Most of us could summarize the trip in 45 seconds, but what if we dug just a little deeper at each step?

What are the layers of abstraction involved and how granualar can we get in 45 minutes?

At every interface connection point we will find a little more illumination on how the web *really* works.

In no way will we cover 'everything' involved in a single form submission. We will however shed some light on previously abstracted black boxes, giving the audience just a little more context on a very complex global system.

Preliminary structure is:
1. Cold Open
2. As a character of Unicode in the browser
3. As a packet in TCP/IP
4. As a POST data stream in nginx
5. As a variable in memory in PHP
6. As a byte on disk in MySQL
