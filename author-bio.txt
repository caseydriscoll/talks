Hello, World!

By day, I'm a senior full-stack, open-source web developer at WebDevStudios. By night, I'm an amateur historian and arm-chair philosopher, fascinated by how things work and what makes people tick.

I like to think of myself as the most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded” man. In the first decade of my adult life, I was a university mascot, a ‘Momentum Monday Man,’ graphic designer, Special Olympics gymnastics coach, (failed) politician, software developer, historian, documentarian, and anger management volunteer. I saw Steve Jobs unveil the iPhone in person at MacWorld 2007. I play too much Civilization, and I've been to Chichen Itza twice. Elon Musk is my homeboy, and
tequila is my drink of choice. My only weakness is Amanda Palmer. Watching the Packers play makes me R-E-L-A-X.

For me though, technology is only a tool for connecting with people and understanding the world around us. For the next decade of my adult life, I want to build things – hopefully cool things that people will want to use, software that helps people and makes the world a better place.
