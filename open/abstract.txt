How are ideas best implemented?

Do ideas grow best behind walled gardens, away from the trampling feet of the commons?

Do ideas grow best in the public space, away from the blinding perspective of singular thought?

Do ideas grow differently in different environments?

Every day I work on projects built on open source code, many of them using open data and built for the public good.

In November of 2016 I will be attending OpenCon, a major conference focused on further creating more open technical environments, especially in the realm of research and higher education.

I will share my experiences, discuss the positives and negatives of 'openness', and advocate for open practices in your life and career.

Preliminary structure is:
1. Cold Open
2. Open Access
3. Open Education
4. Open Data
5. Open Source
6. WordPress out in the Open
